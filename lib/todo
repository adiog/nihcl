FDSet.c: Fix for systems that don't have getdtablesize()

Per class implementaton of deepCopy()?:
	classname* classname::deepCopy() { return classname::castdown(Object::deepCopy()); }

RevIterator (wouldn't have to implement for unsequenced collections).

AVLTree and SplayTree

Add support for microseconds to class Time.

LinkedList::remove(const Object&) -- Object's Link is modified.
